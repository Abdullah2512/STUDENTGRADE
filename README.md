# Student Grade Tracker (Java)

This is a basic Java program I made to keep track of student grades. It runs in the console and asks the user to enter names and marks for multiple students. After all entries, it shows the average, highest, and lowest marks along with the names.

## Features
- Takes input of student names and their marks
- Finds average grade
- Shows which student has the highest and lowest marks
- Displays a small report at the end

## Tools Used
- Java
- Scanner class (for input)
- ArrayList (to store data)

## Why I Made This
This was a small project to improve my basic Java skills, especially working with arrays and loops. It also helped me practice getting user input and doing simple calculations.

## How to Run
Just compile and run the file using any Java IDE or terminal. It will ask for number of students and then take inputs.

- Scanner (for input)
- If-else logic (for replies)
